Currently in development. 

The idea for Hook: The Podcast App, came to me during my time at the intensive Salt bootcamp. I find podcasts to be a somewhat undiscovered media for me, meaning that although I know I would like many of them, I rarely listen. The options for listening are endless, so I thought a nice app would be one that allows me to sift through based on topics I am interested in and save the ones that catch my eye. I originally made this as a web app (see Podcast-App). 

Using the Listen Notes API, you can search through podcasts by keyword. Made using Expo, React/React Native, and Javascript. 

To run this project, you will need a valid API token for the Listen Notes Podcast API. Otherwise set token to 'null'. Runs with yarn and yarn start in the client directory.
